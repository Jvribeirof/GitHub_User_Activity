# GitHub_User_Activity
Use GitHub API to fetch user activity and display it in the terminal.
From: https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity

In this project, I builded a simple command line interface (CLI) to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project helped me practice my programming skills, including working with APIs, handling JSON data, and building a simple CLI application.
